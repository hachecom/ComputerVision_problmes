# Computer Vision Problems
Working with OpenCV and deep learning, tutorials given by Adrian Rosebrock from PyImageSearch
hands-on with CV and DL and using them to solve real-world problems

## No. 1 - Face Recognition
Perform fast, accurate face detection with OpenCV using a pre-trained deep learning face detector model shipped with the library.
## No. 2 - Keras and Convolutional Neural Networks
Building a complete end-to-end image classification + deep learning application
## No. 3 - OpenCV Guide
Learning OpenCV isn’t as hard as it used to be. And in fact, I’ll go as far as to say studying OpenCV has become significantly easier.
## No. 4 - Multiple Choice Exam Scanner

Build a bubble sheet scanner and test grader using Python and OpenCV.

    Detect the exam in an image.
    Apply a perspective transform to extract the top-down, birds-eye-view of the exam.
    Extract the set of bubbles (i.e., the possible answer choices) from the perspective transformed exam.
    Sort the questions/bubbles into rows.
    Determine the marked (i.e., “bubbled in”) answer for each row.
    Determine if the mark was done once in the same question
    Detemine if the answer was done.
    Lookup the correct answer in our answer key to determine if the user was correct in their choice.
    Repeat for all questions in the exam
## No. 5 - OpenCV Text Detection
How to use OpenCV to detect text in natural scene images using the EAST text detector.

## No. 6 - OpenCV Text Recognition
 How to apply OpenCV OCR to perform both:
    Text detection
    Text recognition
To accomplish this task we:
    Utilized OpenCV’s EAST text detector, enabling us to apply deep learning to localize regions of text in an image
    From there, we extracted each of the text ROIs and then applied text recognition using OpenCV and Tesseract v4.
We also looked at Python code to perform both text detection and text recognition in a single script.

## No. 7 - Ball Tracking with OpenCV
The Python script we developed was able to (1) detect the presence of the colored ball, followed by (2) track and draw the position of the ball as it moved around the screen.

## No. 8 - Facial landmarks with dlib, OpenCV, and Python
How to detect and extract facial landmarks using dlib, OpenCV, and Python.
