# Computer Vision Problems
Working with OpenCV and deep learning, tutorials given by Adrian Rosebrock from PyImageSearch
hands-on with CV and DL and using them to solve real-world problems

## No. 1 - Face Recognition
Perform fast, accurate face detection with OpenCV using a pre-trained deep learning face detector model shipped with the library.
## No. 2 - Keras and Convolutional Neural Networks
Building a complete end-to-end image classification + deep learning application

## No. 3 - OpenCV Guide
Learning OpenCV isn’t as hard as it used to be. And in fact, I’ll go as far as to say studying OpenCV has become significantly easier.
