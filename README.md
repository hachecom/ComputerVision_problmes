# Computer Vision Problems
Working with OpenCV and deep learning, tutorials given by Adrian Rosebrock from PyImageSearch
hands-on with CV and DL and using them to solve real-world problems

## No. 1 - Face Recognition
Perform fast, accurate face detection with OpenCV using a pre-trained deep learning face detector model shipped with the library.
## No. 2 - Keras and Convolutional Neural Networks
Building a complete end-to-end image classification + deep learning application
## No. 3 - OpenCV Guide
Learning OpenCV isn’t as hard as it used to be. And in fact, I’ll go as far as to say studying OpenCV has become significantly easier.
## No. 4 - Multiple Choice Exam Scanner

Build a bubble sheet scanner and test grader using Python and OpenCV.

    Detect the exam in an image.
    Apply a perspective transform to extract the top-down, birds-eye-view of the exam.
    Extract the set of bubbles (i.e., the possible answer choices) from the perspective transformed exam.
    Sort the questions/bubbles into rows.
    Determine the marked (i.e., “bubbled in”) answer for each row.
    Determine if the mark was done once in the same question
    Detemine if the answer was done.
    Lookup the correct answer in our answer key to determine if the user was correct in their choice.
    Repeat for all questions in the exam
